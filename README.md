# FluidRecyclerView

Brings the iOS scrolling experience to Android.

## Introduction

`FluidRecyclerView` is a fork version of `RecyclerView` from Android Jetpack, which can reside with the original version side by side. It provides the same public APIs of `RecyclerView`, and you can use it without any code change.

The major differences from the original version:
- Replaced the fling animation to match how it feels in iOS.
- Added the rubber band effect.
- Optimized the velocity calculation algorithm.

üìΩÔ∏è Let's see it in action:

## Getting Started

To use `FluidRecyclerView` in your project, add the JitPack repository to your `settings.gradle.kts` file:

```kotlin
dependencyResolutionManagement {
    repositories {
        // ...
        maven {
            url = URI("https://jitpack.io")
        }
    }
}
```

Then, add the dependency:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    // ...
    implementation("com.github.Helixform:FluidRecyclerView:main-SNAPSHOT")
}
```

Now replace all the packages of `RecyclerView` and related classes with `androidx.fluidrecyclerview.widget.*`:

```patch
- import androidx.recyclerview.widget.RecyclerView
- import androidx.recyclerview.widget.RecyclerView.Adapter
- import androidx.recyclerview.widget.RecyclerView.ViewHolder
+ import androidx.fluidrecyclerview.widget.RecyclerView
+ import androidx.fluidrecyclerview.widget.RecyclerView.Adapter
+ import androidx.fluidrecyclerview.widget.RecyclerView.ViewHolder
```

That's it!
