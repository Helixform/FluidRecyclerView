# FluidRecyclerView

Brings the iOS scrolling experience to Android.

## Introduction

`FluidRecyclerView` is a fork version of `RecyclerView` from Android Jetpack, which can reside with the original version side by side. It provides the same public APIs of `RecyclerView`, and you can use it without any code change.

The major differences from the original version:
- Replaced the fling animation to match how it feels in iOS.
- Added the rubber band effect.
- Optimized the velocity calculation algorithm.

This library takes code from [fluid-scroll](https://github.com/ktiays/fluid-scroll), which ports many important algorithms like spring simulation, velocity calculation, etc. Check it out if you are looking for implementations for other platforms.

## Getting Started

To use `FluidRecyclerView` in your project, add the JitPack repository to your `settings.gradle.kts` file:

```kotlin
dependencyResolutionManagement {
    repositories {
        // ...
        maven {
            url = URI("https://jitpack.io")
        }
    }
}
```

Then, add the dependency:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    // ...
    implementation("com.github.Helixform:FluidRecyclerView:main-SNAPSHOT")
}
```

Now replace all the packages of `RecyclerView` and related classes with `androidx.fluidrecyclerview.widget.*`:

```patch
- import androidx.recyclerview.widget.RecyclerView
- import androidx.recyclerview.widget.RecyclerView.Adapter
- import androidx.recyclerview.widget.RecyclerView.ViewHolder
+ import androidx.fluidrecyclerview.widget.RecyclerView
+ import androidx.fluidrecyclerview.widget.RecyclerView.Adapter
+ import androidx.fluidrecyclerview.widget.RecyclerView.ViewHolder
```

That's it!

## FAQ

### Which version of RecyclerView is this library based on?

The library is forked from `androidx.recyclerview:recyclerview:1.3.1` ([commit](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/support/+/68f4660cd40b87c9383c5c7d86ae26ebccbf93e8)), and currently have no plans to synchronize with higher versions.

### Is there any public API changes?

No. But note that some internal methods & classes have been changed or removed. If you are using some private APIs via reflection, your app may behave abnormally.

### Why is it still using `androidx` package name?

The library uses some package-visible APIs from other AndroidX components. To reduce unnecessary modifications and impacts of using this library, we just renamed the child packages.

### Can I change the scrolling behavior dynamically?

It's not supported currently. Since this library can coexist with the original `RecyclerView`, you can implement that feature at app level.
